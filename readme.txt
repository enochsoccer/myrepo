git add <filename>  /  to stage a commit
git commit -m "descriptive message"  /  to commit your changes 
git push  /  pushes changes from master locally to master on GitHub
git push origin <branchname>  /  origin is where you cloned repo from; pushes contents from <branchname> to origin
git pull origin <branchname>  /  pulls contents from GitHub to local repo
git ls-files  /  lists files
